#### What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The code I was given contained the evironment for the agent, in this case the maze. I was also given code for capturing the experience replay which stores all the episodes to be used in predicting the best path in future as well as code for the build model for the neural network. Lastly, I was given code to run the maze and ensure that my code resulted in the agent making it's way through the maze correctly. The code I made myself was for the implementation of the Q-Training algorithm. This code served to allow the agent to make it's way through the maze using the best possible navigation sequence. 

#### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists seek to uncover new and innovative ways to solve problems both common and unusual through the use of technology. This matters because there are always going to be problems that require solutions and by utilizing the resources at our disposal, such as technology, we can uncover new ways to improve the lifes of others. 

#### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I start on a new problem by looking at the overall issue, then break it down into elements that can be easily understood and dealt with. When I run into issues that I feel I am unable to come up with a good enough solution on my own I will seek out others to aid me in determining the best solution for a given problem.

#### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
I have a personal responsibility to ensure the the solutions I design are as ethical as possible and cannot easily be manipulated into something harmful to others. Because I am tasked with the responsibilty to create things that other people may not understand, I have an ethical responsibility to prevent my work from harming those who use it.
